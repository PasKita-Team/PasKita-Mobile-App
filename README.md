## PasKita-Mobile-App

"Paskita" project came from an understanding of the important role
that Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) play in the economy, which often have difficulties in
promoting their products and services. We noticed that resources and professional design
skills are limited for SME, making it difficult for them to create effective promotions. Therefore,
the "Paskita" project comes as a solution by giving SME access to a collection of creative
templates that are simple and easy to use. By using the "PasKita" app, SME can easily
customize these templates to create attractive promotions without having to rely on expensive
professional design services.
